# Console-Finances JavaScript Project

## Description


I've completed this project to implement skills acquired during the fourth week of EDX front-end development bootcamp. I was tasked with creating creating JavaScript code for analyzing the financial records of a company, as presented on the screenshot below:

Creating this code allowed me to:


 <li>Better understand some JavaScript terminology, such as array, nested array, loop, function, method etc.</li>
 <li>Practice writing concise, easy to ready JavaScript code.</li>
 <li>Practice searching for solutions to specific problems online and adjust procured answers and code snippets to my own needs.</li>
 <li>Linking JavaScript into HTML.</li>
<li>Practice GitHub workflow </li><br>


## Installation


No installation is required. The deployed website can be seen at https://manonthemon.github.io/Console-Finances/. To see the program working, enter the page, press F12 to enter Chrome Devtools and open the console. The edited .js and .html files can be found in the repository.<br>

## Usage

This project can serve those wiling to learn more about JavaScript functions, arrays and methods. The code includes detailed comments to allow users to better understand its inner workings.
